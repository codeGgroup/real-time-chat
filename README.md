## Getting started

- Clone the repository
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/codeGgroup/real-time-chat.git
  ```
  - Identify your feature and checkout to the branch that concerns it. E.g if you're working on the `View contact info`
    issue. You can do,
    ```shell
    git branch --all
    ```
    to see all the branches, then choose which one concerns you feature and checkout to it like this:
    ```shell
    git checkout 12-view-contact-info
    ```
- Create the files your need and start working.
- When you're done, do a commit and push
  ```shell
  git add <filename>
  ```
  or in case of multiple files
  ```shell
  git add <file1> <file2> <file3>
  ```
  then commit:
  ```shell
  git commit -m "enter the commit message to describe your work"
  ```
  If you can sign your commits, that is recommended. If not, please don't worry about it.
  you can look at my commits to take an example.
  then push
  ```shell
  git push
  ```
  If your are pushing for the first time to that branch, do:
  ```shell
  git push -u origin <branch-name>
  ```
